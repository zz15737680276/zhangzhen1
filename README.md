# SyntenyPlot

	usage: synteny_plot.pl global.config synteny.config annotation.config output.svg

## Descriptions:

	Produce publishable vector-format synteny views using user-defined parameter and datasets

	SVG format further improvement could be achieved using Adobe Illustrator on Windows or Inkscape on Linux. 

	>Click *block4.svg* for an example, to see what the output svg looks like.

## Requirements: 

	Perl Modules: SVG, Data::Dumper

#HOW-TO

### 1. **user.config**

user.config contains plot parameter for the plot, including length, height, and color of line and fillins

>		Better to defined the sequence length here as autodetected length by this script might not be the real length

### 2. **synteny.config**

synteny.config specifies the syntonic region between two sequences

>		*Only first 6 column are necessart

>		*END not necessarily larger than start

>		*Could use whole.genome.alignments.pipeline.sh to generate

>		*whole.genome.alignments.pipeline.sh use LAST for pairwise alinment and ChainNet to join close alignments into larger blocks

>		*Final format:	

>			#REF1	START1	END1	REF2	START2	END2	...

### 3. **anntation.config**

anntation.config specifies the gene/feature/repeat locations

>		*Feature ID of non-EXPRESSION tracks must be unique

>		*For EXPRESSION track, note the FEATURE_ID and TISSUE change in col2 and col3, and the STDEV is before the AVERAGE;

>		*check /examples/block4/annotation.config for examples

>		*Curently CDS might not supplorted very vell as can not link the individual CDS box using lines.

### TO-DO list;

+ [ ] 1. Support CDS TRACKs

+ [ ] 2. Make delicate legends.

+ [ ] 3. Avoid Tick marks out of main plot

+ [ ] 4. Regenerate examples
